# InsightExtractor


The Insight Extractor was the ML model that Considdr used to idenitfy abstractive sentences in full text documents on the web. Considdr closed in the summer of 2020 and now we're making our model freely available to all. We'd love to hear the interesting ways people apply this model. All we ask is that you cite this repo.

Abstractive sentences are of particular value when it comes to understanding the key insights in adjacent documents. For more on this summarization approach see "Summarization by Adjacent Document."
